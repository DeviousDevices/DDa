DEVIOUS DEVICES: ASSETS (v2.8.3)
for TES V: Skyrim
by Zadil



-Description-

This is a collection of BDSM-themed gear and devices for the CBBE 3.2.3 (Curvy) & UNPB 2.5.2 female body, with additional tweaks for the UNP 1.2 (Skinny) body included.

A comprehensive list of mods that use these devices can be found here:
http://www.loverslab.com/topic/30855-devious-skyrim/#entry770752

It is recommended to use DD:Assets with other DD mods like DD:Integration that make the content available ingame.



-Usage-

This mod is BAIN/FOMOD enabled, as such it is strongly recommended to install it using the install manager of your choice (MO/NMM/Wrye) and follow the onscreen instruction.
Alternatively the mod can be installed manually by copying the contents of the numbered folders into the Skyrim/Data directory. However make sure to -only- include the most applicable folder for each number, if any.



-Requirements-

CBBE v3.2.3 (Curvy) / UNPB 2.5.2 / UNP 1.2 (Skinny)
The assets were created for the CBBE 3.2.3 (curvy) and UNPB 2.5.2 female body. A slightly tweaked version for the UNP 1.2 (skinny) body is also included.
Other body types and variations are not officially supported and may result in visual anomalies.

SexLab Framework
Some items in this package have SexLab keywords attached to them to ensure compatibility with other adult mods.



-Known Issues-

Headgear (gags, blingfold,...) may not always fit perfectly depending on the character's race and facial features.
Minor clipping and/or deformation issues may occur when the character assumes extreme poses or performs certain movements.



-Frequently Asked Questions-

[#1 - How do I access or use these devices?]
Devious Devices: Assets is a modder's resource and doesn't place the items ingame nor assign them or provide support for custom ingame behaviour - these aspects are handled and maintained by seperate 'Devious Devices' mods. Any issues with such should thus be referred to the respective mod author.

[#2 - Why is a certain device not working properly?]
See question #1.

[#3 - Why do some devices not fit my player character?]
These assets were made for a specific set of bodies (see 'Requirements'). Other body types are not supported and may cause visual anomalies.

[#4 - Will there ever be support for males/beast races/additional bodies?]
Unlikely due to lack of public and personal interest.

[#5 - Can I use these items in my own mod?]
Yes, but please do not merge/repack/redistribute or use its contents for other purposes without expressed permission.

[#6 - Can I make suggestions regarding future content?]
Ideas about additional devices can be shared in the Devious Devices: Assets support thread. Keep in mind that devices requiring custom animations are unlikely to be realized.

[#7 - When will the next version of this mod be released and what will be included?]
No idea
