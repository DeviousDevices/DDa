-Frequently Asked Questions-

Q: How do I access or use these devices?
A: Devious Devices: Assets is a modder's resource and doesn't place the items ingame nor assign them or provide support for custom ingame behaviour. The resources are meant to be used by the Devious Devices Integration framework and content mods making use of the framework. Any issues with such should thus be referred to the respective mod author.

Q: Why is a certain device not working properly?
A: See question #1.

Q: Why do some devices not fit my player character?
You probably forgot to use Bodyslide to build the items. That or you are not using one of the supported body mods. Other body types are not supported and may/will cause visual anomalies.

Q: Will there ever be support for males/beast races?
A: No.

Q: Will there ever be support for additional bodies?
A: CBBE Bodyslide and UUNP are the most widely used and the most versatile body mods available for Skyrim. There is hardly any good reason to use another body. Given the stage in Skyrim's lifescycle, it is very unlikely to see a new body mod getting released with the potential to surpass either CBBE's or UUNP's popularity. We also do no want to continue support for older fixed-shape body mods, as this would increase our modellers' workload for little gain. You can use Bodyslide to generate any body shape you wish, so there is no point in supporting a fixed-shape body. The last version of DDA supporting CBBE Curvy and UNP will remain available as an unsupported legacy download for those still using these bodies.

Q: Can I use these items in my own mod?
A: Yes, but please do not merge/repack/redistribute or use its contents for other purposes without expressed permission.

Q: Can I make suggestions regarding future content?
A: This mod is considered final. New assets will be added to Devious Devices Expansion only.
